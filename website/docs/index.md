These files are mainly designed for use with musescore, but MusicXML files are also provided.

MuseScore is free open source software.

## Musescore installation

#### Youtube Videos

[Installing applications on Macintosh (Appstore and Downloaded)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg2qhKkdrnA)

I don't think Musescore is in the application store, the relevant bit starts at about 1 min 45 seconds. This one is presented by Harry Potter.

[Installing MuseScore on Windows/MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU3YlZ4pjEc)

The process is for Windows but MacOS is much the same, apparently.

Another alternative is to download the non musehub version "Musescore Studio without Musehub"

## Note

When doing the tutorial I forgot to mention that you can make it play straight left to write by clicking on the "Page View" button at the bottom right.
